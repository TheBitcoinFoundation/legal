This Policy is only applicable to the Website and the services and content available on the Website, and not to any other websites that you may be able to access from the Website and related services and content, each of which may have data collection and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Policy.

#####**NOTICE CONCERNING CHILDREN**

*PLEASE NOTE:* Our Website is operated for an adult audience only, and we require users and visitors of the Website to be at least 18 years of age.

When you visit or make use of the Website we may collect some information about you automatically.

The Website may also gather “traffic data” that may be helpful for improving the services we offer.

*COOKIES.* We may use “cookies” (a small piece of data stored on your computer’s hard drive). Cookies help us learn which areas of our Website are useful and which areas need improvement. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings on your browser. However, if you choose to disable this function, your experience on the Website may be diminished and some features may not work as they were intended.

*PERSONAL INFORMATION.* We will not share your personal information with any third parties without your consent, except as necessary to provide you with the services offered by us, with third-party vendors, consultants and service providers who need access to this data to carry out their work for us, to protect the rights or property of The Bitcoin Foundation, in an emergency to protect the personal safety of The Bitcoin Foundation's employees, customers or any other person, or to comply with the law. We may use your personal information to verify your identity or to check your qualifications.  We may also use your contact information to inform you of any changes to the Website, or to send you additional information about The Bitcoin Foundation.

*ANONYMOUS INFORMATION.* We use anonymous information to analyze our Website traffic, but we do not examine this information for individually identifying information. In addition, we may use anonymous IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer the Website, or to display content according to your preferences.
